# Mindset: The New Psychology of Success

## Key Ideas

- **Fixed mindset**: believing abilities are innate and unchangeable
- **Growth mindset**: believing abilities can be developed through effort and practice
- [[Growth Mindset]] students embrace challenges, persist through setbacks, and see effort as the path to mastery
- Praise for effort ("you worked hard") promotes growth mindset; praise for talent ("you're so smart") promotes fixed mindset
- Mindset affects how people handle failure -- growth-oriented learners treat it as information

## Quotes

> "Becoming is better than being."

> "The view you adopt for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your life."

## Connections

- Growth mindset is a prerequisite for engaging with [[Desirable Difficulties]]
- Connects to [[Motivation and Learning]] -- intrinsic drive requires believing effort matters
- [[Self-Determination Theory]] provides a complementary framework on autonomy and competence
- Relevant to [[Metacognition]] -- self-awareness of one's own mindset
- Informs [[Teaching Methodology Research]] on how to frame feedback
