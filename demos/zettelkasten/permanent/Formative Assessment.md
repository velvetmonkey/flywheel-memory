# Formative Assessment

Formative assessment is the ongoing process of gathering evidence about student learning during instruction to provide feedback that guides both teaching and learning. Unlike summative assessment (final exams, grades), formative assessment is *for* learning, not *of* learning.

## Key Practices

1. **Clarifying learning intentions**: Students know what they're aiming for
2. **Eliciting evidence**: Questioning, observations, exit tickets, quick quizzes
3. **Providing feedback**: Specific, actionable guidance on how to improve
4. **Peer and self-assessment**: Students learn to evaluate their own and others' work
5. **Adjusting instruction**: Teachers modify their approach based on evidence

## Connection to Learning Science

- Leverages the [[Testing Effect]] -- frequent low-stakes quizzes strengthen memory
- Provides external calibration against [[Dunning-Kruger Effect]] miscalibration
- Supports [[Deliberate Practice]] by identifying specific areas for improvement
- Develops [[Metacognition]] through self-assessment activities
- Aligns with [[Self-Determination Theory]] competence needs -- feedback shows growth

## Connections

- Exploits the [[Testing Effect]] for learning through assessment
- Corrects [[Dunning-Kruger Effect]] self-assessment errors
- Enables targeted [[Deliberate Practice]]
- Builds [[Metacognition]] through reflection on performance
- Core practice in [[Teaching Methodology Research]]
- Supports [[Growth Mindset]] when feedback is process-oriented
