# Active Recall

Active recall is the practice of stimulating memory retrieval during learning. Rather than passively re-reading notes, the learner actively tries to recall information from memory, strengthening neural pathways each time.

## Why It Works

Every act of retrieval modifies the memory trace, making it more accessible in the future. This is the basis of the [[Testing Effect]] -- being tested on material is more effective for learning than additional study time. The effort required during retrieval is a form of [[Desirable Difficulties]].

## Methods

- **Flashcards**: The classic active recall tool, especially with [[Spaced Repetition]]
- **Practice questions**: Self-testing after reading
- **Blank page method**: Close the book and write everything you remember
- **[[Elaborative Interrogation]]**: Asking yourself "why is this true?" forces retrieval and connection

## Common Misconceptions

People often feel that re-reading is effective because of fluency -- the text looks familiar. But this is an illusion of competence (see [[Metacognition]] and the [[Dunning-Kruger Effect]]). True learning requires the struggle of retrieval.

## Connections

- Powers [[Spaced Repetition]] systems -- each review is an act of recall
- The [[Testing Effect]] is active recall applied in an assessment context
- [[Elaborative Interrogation]] is a deeper form of active recall
- Builds stronger [[Schema Theory]] structures by forcing integration
