- [x] Week planning
- [x] Review course funnel metrics
- [x] Research newsletter topic
- [x] Write newsletter outline

## Notes

Two course sales overnight - both from the Thursday newsletter CTA. The "2026 Predictions" issue had a strong call to action for the course. Proves the content-to-product funnel works.

Subscriber growth is concerning though. Only +23 net last week vs target of +50. Need to think about:
- Guest posts on other newsletters
- LinkedIn content push
- Referral incentive

Tuesday newsletter topic: "5 Claude Code Workflows That Save Me 10 Hours/Week". This angle worked before.
