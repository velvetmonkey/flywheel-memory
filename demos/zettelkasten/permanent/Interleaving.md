# Interleaving

Interleaving is the practice of mixing different topics, problem types, or skills during study sessions rather than focusing on one type at a time (blocked practice). Despite feeling less productive, interleaving produces superior learning.

## Why It Works

- Forces the learner to discriminate between problem types -- "which strategy applies here?"
- Strengthens retrieval pathways by associating each concept with its appropriate context
- Prevents the illusion of competence that arises from blocked practice repetition
- Qualifies as a [[Desirable Difficulties]] because it feels harder but produces better outcomes

## Evidence

Rohrer & Taylor (2007) showed that interleaved math practice produced 43% better test performance compared to blocked practice. Similar results appear in motor learning, medical diagnosis, and art classification.

## When to Use Interleaving

- When learning related but distinct categories or procedures
- After initial exposure to each individual concept (some blocked practice first is fine)
- In combination with [[Spaced Repetition]] for maximum effect

## Connections

- A key [[Desirable Difficulties]] alongside the [[Spacing Effect]]
- Works synergistically with [[Active Recall]] -- each switch requires retrieval
- Supports [[Transfer of Learning]] by building flexible, discriminative knowledge
- [[Cognitive Load Theory]] caution: interleaving increases load, so ensure the base concepts are understood first
