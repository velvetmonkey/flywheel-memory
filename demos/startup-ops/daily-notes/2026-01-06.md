**Automation trigger**: GrowthStack decision pending

## Tomorrow

- [ ] Day 2 check-in with DataDriven Co
- [ ] Investor call with [[Velocity Ventures]] (4pm)
- [ ] [[Review Feature Priorities]] - add dashboard refresh bug

## [[Notes

Incredible]] day. [[Watching Sarah]]'s face [[When]] she [[Created]] that dashboard in 15 minutes - that's the "aha [[Moment]]" we talk about in [[Customer Onboarding]]. Time-to-[[Value]] is [[Everything]].

GrowthStack is a [[Test]] of our enterprise readiness. If they convert, SSO becomes P1 and we're officially moving into [[Mid]]-[[Market]] (100-500 employees). That's a [[Strategic]] decision - does it fit [[DEC-002 Target Market]]? [[Need]] to discuss with Alex.

Status: [[High]] momentum
