# Teaching Methodology Research

Survey evidence-based teaching practices and compile recommendations for educators who want to align instruction with cognitive science.

## Research Questions

1. How can teachers leverage the [[Testing Effect]] in daily instruction?
2. What role does [[Formative Assessment]] play in learning outcomes?
3. How should [[Cognitive Load Theory]] influence lesson design?
4. How can teachers foster [[Growth Mindset]] without empty praise?
5. What does [[Self-Determination Theory]] suggest about classroom autonomy?

## Key Findings So Far

### Assessment as Learning
- Low-stakes quizzing exploits the [[Testing Effect]] and fights the [[Dunning-Kruger Effect]]
- [[Formative Assessment]] provides real-time feedback for both teachers and students
- Self-assessment builds [[Metacognition]]

### Instructional Design
- [[Cognitive Load Theory]] principles: reduce extraneous load, manage intrinsic load, maximise germane load
- [[Dual Coding Theory]]: combine visual and verbal presentations
- [[Interleaving]] practice problems across topics within homework sets
- Use worked examples for novices (see [[Schema Theory]] expertise reversal)

### Motivation and Mindset
- [[Growth Mindset]] framing in feedback (praise effort and strategy, not talent)
- [[Self-Determination Theory]]: give students choices, build competence, foster belonging
- [[Motivation and Learning]] as the foundation -- no technique works without engagement

### Study Skills Instruction
- Explicitly teach [[Active Recall]], [[Spaced Repetition]], and [[Elaborative Interrogation]]
- Help students recognise illusions of learning ([[Metacognition]])
- Model effective study habits based on [[Desirable Difficulties]]

## Connections

- Informs [[Learning System Design]] from the instructor perspective
- Draws heavily on all permanent notes in this vault
- Feeds into [[Effective Study Habits]] practical recommendations
- [[Curriculum Design for Retention]] is a sub-project
