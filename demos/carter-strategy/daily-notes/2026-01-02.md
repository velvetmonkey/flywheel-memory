## Tasks

### Completed Today
- [x] Acme sprint review call
- [x] [[TechStart]] code review session
- [x] Update TechStart proposal

### [[Carried Forward]]
- [ ] Send [[TechStart Phase 2]] proposal to Mike 📅 2026-01-05
- [ ] Follow up on [[INV-2025-048]] payment 📅 2026-01-07
- [ ] Review performance test results with James 📅 2026-01-08

### [[New Tasks]]
- [ ] Document supplier data encoding fix for [[Data Migration Playbook]] 📅 2026-01-10

## Notes

Good productive day. Acme project is tracking well - 80% validation is ahead of schedule. The supplier data issue was tricky but we found a clean fix.

TechStart handover went smoothly. Mike seems positive on [[Phase 2]] - said he'll have budget answer by [[Jan 15]].

Need to follow up on that December invoice - Acme usually pays within 30 days but holidays may have delayed.

## Reflections

- Validation automation is paying off - manual would have taken weeks
- Multi-tenant proposal section needed more detail than expected
- Should block time for knowledge updates (playbook is getting stale)
