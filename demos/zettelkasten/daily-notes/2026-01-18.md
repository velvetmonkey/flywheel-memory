# 2026-01-18

## Study Log

Today I experimented with [[Interleaving]] during my math practice. Instead of doing all calculus problems then all linear algebra problems, I mixed them randomly. It felt much harder and I made more errors initially, but by the end of the session I was much better at identifying which approach to use. Classic [[Desirable Difficulties]] at work.

## New Fleeting Note

Captured [[idea-dual-coding-in-notes|an idea about dual coding in notes]]. What if every permanent note included a diagram? Need to investigate whether the overhead is worth it given [[Cognitive Load Theory]] considerations.

## Connections Made

Realised that [[Elaborative Interrogation]] and [[Active Recall]] are related but distinct -- active recall asks "what do I know?", elaborative interrogation asks "why is this true?". Both are retrieval processes but they target different depths.

## Working On

- [[Effective Study Habits]] -- added section on what to do less of
- [[Teaching Methodology Research]] -- compiled notes on formative assessment
