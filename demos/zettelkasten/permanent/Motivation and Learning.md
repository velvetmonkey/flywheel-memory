# Motivation and Learning

Motivation is the engine that drives learning behaviour. Without it, even the most evidence-based study techniques fail because learners simply won't engage with them. Understanding motivation is essential for designing effective learning systems.

## Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation

- **Intrinsic motivation**: Learning driven by curiosity, interest, and the inherent satisfaction of mastery
- **Extrinsic motivation**: Learning driven by external rewards (grades, money, praise) or punishments
- Research consistently shows that intrinsic motivation produces deeper, more durable learning

## The Overjustification Effect

When extrinsic rewards are offered for an intrinsically interesting activity, intrinsic motivation can decrease. This has profound implications for educational incentive systems.

## [[Self-Determination Theory]] Framework

Deci and Ryan identify three psychological needs that drive intrinsic motivation:
- **Autonomy**: Feeling in control of one's own learning
- **Competence**: Experiencing mastery and growth (connects to [[Growth Mindset]])
- **Relatedness**: Feeling connected to others

## Connections

- [[Self-Determination Theory]] provides the most comprehensive motivational framework
- [[Growth Mindset]] sustains motivation through setbacks
- [[Flow State]] represents peak motivational experience
- [[Deliberate Practice]] requires sustained motivation to push through discomfort
- [[Metacognition]] helps learners self-regulate motivation
- Central concern in [[Teaching Methodology Research]]
