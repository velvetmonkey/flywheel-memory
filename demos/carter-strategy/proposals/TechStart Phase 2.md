# [[TechStart]] [[Phase 2]] Proposal

## Overview

Follow-on engagement with [[TechStart Inc]] to build out advanced features for their MVP, including multi-tenant architecture, [[Analytics Dashboard]], and [[API Marketplace]] integration.

**Client**: [[TechStart Inc]]
**Contact**: [[Mike Chen]], CTO
**Value**: $45,000
**Duration**: 3 months (Feb - Apr 2026)
**Status**: Pending decision

## Background

[[TechStart MVP Build]] (Phase 1) successfully delivered core product features:
- User authentication system
- Core API endpoints
- Basic admin dashboard
- Deployment pipeline

Phase 2 builds on this foundation with enterprise-ready features.

## Proposed Scope

### 1. Multi-Tenant Architecture ($18,000)
- Tenant isolation and data partitioning
- Per-tenant configuration
- Tenant provisioning automation
- Estimated: 60 hours

### 2. Analytics Dashboard ($15,000)
- Usage metrics visualization
- Custom reporting
- Export capabilities
- Estimated: 50 hours

### 3. API Marketplace Integration ($12,000)
- OAuth 2.0 implementation
- Rate limiting
- API documentation portal
- Estimated: 40 hours

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Deliverable |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Multi-Tenant | 4 weeks | Architecture + implementation |
| Analytics | 3 weeks | Dashboard MVP |
| API Marketplace | 2.5 weeks | Integration complete |
| Buffer/Polish | 1 week | Testing, documentation |

## Tasks

- [ ] Follow up with Mike on decision 📅 2026-01-08
- [ ] Prepare technical clarifications doc 📅 2026-01-06
- [ ] Schedule call if questions arise 📅 2026-01-10
- [ ] If accepted, draft SOW 📅 2026-01-17

## Dependencies

**[[On Client]]**:
- Decision by [[January 15]]
- Access to existing codebase
- Stakeholder availability for reviews

**[[On Us]]**:
- Complete [[TechStart MVP Build]] final handover
- Clear February calendar for kickoff

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Decision delay | Follow up proactively |
| Scope creep | Fixed scope SOW |
| Tech debt from MVP | Budget cleanup time |

## [[Competitive Position]]

TechStart is also considering:
- In-house development (but team is stretched)
- Another consultant (more expensive, less context)

**Our advantage**: Deep context from [[Phase 1]], existing relationship, proven delivery.

## [[Pricing Rationale]]

| Rate | Hours | Amount |
|------|-------|--------|
| $300/hr | 150 | $45,000 |

Competitive with Phase 1 ($25K for 83 hours), reflects increased scope complexity.
