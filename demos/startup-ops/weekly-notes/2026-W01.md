# [[Week 01]] - 2026 ([[Jan 1]]-7)

## [[Summary

Strong]] start to 2026. Made critical [[Strategic]] decision on [[Target Market]] ([[Dec]]-002), [[Successfully]] onboarded [[First]] customer ([[DataDriven Co]]), and had promising [[Investor Intro]] ([[Velocity Ventures]]). [[One]] [[Technical]] issue emerged (dashboard refresh bug) [[But]] being addressed.

## [[Key Accomplishments]]

### [[Strategic Decisions]]
- **[[Target]] [[Market]] ICP finalized** ([[DEC-002 Target Market]])
  - [[Focus]]: 50-200 employee SMBs, (1M rows, $5M-$50M revenue
  - Anti-ICP: <20 employees, )500 employees, >5M rows
  - Rationale: [[InsightHub]] churn confirmed we [[Need]] tighter ICP

### [[Customer Success]]
- **[[DataDriven]] Co onboarding** - [[Week 1]] of [[Customer Onboarding]] playbook
  - Kickoff call: [[Created]] first dashboard in 15 minutes ([[Production]] yield)
  - [[Day 2]]: Sarah connected second [[Data]] source, Tom created 3 dashboards solo
  - [[Status]]: [[Active]], [[High]] [[Engagement]], renewal [[Risk]] low
  - Issue: Dashboard refresh bug impacting experience (Alex prioritizing fix)

- **[[GrowthStack]] trial extended**
  - SSO [[Timeline]] confirmed (Q2 delivery)
  - Decision pending [[Friday]] ([[Jan 10]])
  - Potential: $1,999/mo Enterprise plan if they convert

### Fundraising
- **Velocity Ventures intro call** (Jan 7)
  - Positive reception to SMB focus and time-to-value
  - Concern: Only 1 paying customer (need more proof)
  - Next: Portfolio company intros this week

## [[Insights]] & Learnings

### [[What Worked]]

- **[[Customer Onboarding]] playbook** - Kept DataDriven Co kickoff [[On Track]]
- **Time-to-[[Value]]** - 15 min to first dashboard is our superpower

### [[What Didn]]'t Work
- **Dashboard refresh [[Reliability]]** - [[Bug Found]] in production ([[Should]] [[Have]] caught in [[Testing]])
- **Trial conversion** - 3 active trials but [[None]] converting yet
- **Outbound volume** - Jamie [[Only]] reached 5 prospects (need 10+/week)

### [[Key Quotes]]

**Sarah (DataDriven Co):**
> "This [[Would]] have taken me 2 days in Excel. I'm sold."

**Priya ([[Velocity]] Ventures):**
> "We like the [[SMB Focus]], but 1 customer isn't enough proof. [[Get]] to 5 and we'll talk terms."

## [[Health Check]]

**Velocity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High - [[Strong]] customer success, clear [[Strategy]])
**Revenue**: ⭐⭐ (Low - Only $499 MRR, need pipeline)
**Product**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Medium - Good features, but refresh bug concerning)
**Team**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High - Alex & Jamie aligned, focused execution)

**Overall**: 🟢 Healthy start to year, execution strong, revenue needs work
