# 2026-01-15

## Morning Thoughts

Started the day reviewing my fleeting notes from this week. The [[idea-spaced-repetition|idea about spaced repetition]] seems worth developing into a full permanent note. Also revisited my [[thought-on-metacognition|thought on metacognition]] -- I think there's a deeper connection between self-monitoring and effective study.

## Study Session

Spent 45 minutes working through the [[Learning System Design]] project. Key insight: the system needs to make [[Active Recall]] the default mode, not something you opt into. Re-reading is the path of least resistance.

## Reading

Started reading chapters 3-4 of [[Make It Stick]]. The section on illusions of learning hit hard -- I've been guilty of equating familiarity with understanding. This connects to the [[Dunning-Kruger Effect]].

## Tasks

- [x] Process fleeting note on spaced repetition into permanent note
- [ ] Finish [[Make It Stick]] chapters 5-6
- [ ] Review [[Spacing Effect]] flashcards
