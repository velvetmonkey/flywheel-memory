Rebuild from scratch.\n3. **Cattle not pets** — Services on [[Kubernetes]] should be disposable and replaceable.\n\n## Anti-patterns to avoid\n\n- Snowflake servers\n- Manual database migrations (use [[PostgreSQL]] migration tools)\n- Hardcoded configuration values\n- Monolithic deployments (embrace [[Microservices]])\n\n## Inspiration\n\nDavid Chen wrote a great internal blog post about this.
