# 2026-01-03 - [[Target Market Decision]]

## [[Log]]

**09:00** - Review [[InsightHub]] churn post-mortem
- Customer: [[InsightHub]]
- Churn reason: [[Performance]] on 10M+ rows
- Lesson: [[Don]]'t chase [[High]]-volume [[Data]] customers yet
- [[This]] confirms we [[Need]] clearer ICP boundaries

**10:30** - [[Target Market]] decision [[Session]] (Alex + Jamie)
- Topic: [[DEC-002 Target Market]]
- **Decision made**: [[Focus]] on 50-200 employee SMBs, (1M rows
- Anti-ICP: <20 employees (too small), )500 employees (need enterprise [[Features]] we don't [[Have]])
- Rationale: [[DataDriven Co]] is perfect fit, InsightHub was wrong fit

**13:00** - [[Updated]] [[Sales Messaging]]
- New pitch: "Analytics for growing SMBs who've outgrown spreadsheets"
- Differentiation: 10x [[Faster]] setup than Tableau, 1/2 the [[Price]]
- ICP qualifier: Ask [[Data Volume]] upfront (<1M rows = [[Good]] fit)

**15:30** - [[LinkedIn]] outreach prep
- [[Target]]: Ops/analytics leads at 50-200 person companies
- Industries: Manufacturing (like [[DataDriven]] Co), logistics, [[Professional Services]]
- Message template: "Outgrown spreadsheets? [[Get]] dashboards in 30 min"

## [[Decisions

Created]] [[DEC-002 Target Market]] - major [[Strategic]] decision
- Primary target: 50-200 employees, <1M rows, $5M-$50M revenue
- Caveat: Will take select 100-500 employee deals if [[They]] fit data profile
- [[Success Metrics]]: 80%+ customers fit ICP by [[Mar 2026]], <20% churn

## [[Wins]]

- Clarity on who we serve (and who we don't)
- InsightHub churn makes sense [[Now]] (they were anti-ICP)
- Sales messaging simplified

## Challenges

- Saying "no" to enterprise deals will be hard
- Need to educate [[Market]] on our sweet spot
- May leave money on table short-term

## [[Next]] Week

- [ ] Update website copy with new ICP messaging
- [ ] Create sales qualification checklist
- [ ] Outreach to 10 ICP-fit companies
- [ ] [[Review Pricing Model]] - does it still fit ICP?

## [[Notes

Big]] day. Having a clear ICP feels clarifying. We were trying to be [[Everything]] to everyone, and it led to InsightHub churn.

[[Key]] insight from Alex: "Better to dominate a niche than be mediocre everywhere." We're the [[Best]] analytics tool for 50-200 person SMBs who've outgrown spreadsheets. That's our lane.

[[Now Jamie]]'s outbound has a target. [[Now Alex]]'s roadmap has a customer profile. Now we can say "no" to deals that don't fit.

[[Status]]: Energized
