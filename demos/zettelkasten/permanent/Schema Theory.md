# Schema Theory

A schema is a mental framework or template that organises related pieces of information into a single, retrievable structure. Schemas allow experts to process complex information rapidly and with minimal [[Working Memory]] load.

## How Schemas Work

- New information is interpreted through existing schemas (assimilation)
- When new information doesn't fit, schemas are modified (accommodation)
- Well-developed schemas allow automatic processing, freeing [[Working Memory]] for higher-order thinking
- [[Chunking]] is the process of building schemas from individual elements

## In Education

- Novices lack schemas and must process each element individually (high [[Cognitive Load Theory]] burden)
- Experts have rich schema libraries -- they see patterns where novices see chaos
- Instruction should help students build schemas through worked examples and guided practice
- [[Deliberate Practice]] systematically builds and refines schemas

## The Expertise Reversal Effect

Scaffolding designed for novices (who lack schemas) can actually hinder experts (who already have them). This means instructional design must adapt to the learner's schema development level.

## Connections

- [[Chunking]] is the mechanism by which schemas are formed
- [[Cognitive Load Theory]] is built on the assumption that schemas reduce processing demands
- [[Working Memory]] limitations make schema construction essential
- [[Deliberate Practice]] is the path to expert-level schema development
- [[Transfer of Learning]] depends on having abstract, flexible schemas
