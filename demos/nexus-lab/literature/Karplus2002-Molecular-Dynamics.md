# Molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules

## [[Summary

Foundational]] review of molecular dynamics (MD) for studying protein motion. [[Established]] MD as [[Essential]] tool for understanding protein function through dynamics.

## [[Key Concepts]]

- **Force fields**: [[AMBER Force Field]], [[CHARMM Force Field]]
- **Timescales**: Accessing microsecond dynamics
- **Ensemble sampling**: Conformational space exploration

## Methodology

[[Newtonian Mechanics]] [[Integration]] for [[Protein Conformational Dynamics]]. [[Periodic Boundary Conditions]] for solvent simulation.

## Relevance to [[My Work

Theoretical]] basis for [[Protein-Ligand Docking]] refinement. [[AMBER Force Field]] [[Used In]] [[Experiment-2024-11-22]].

## [[Applications]]

- [[Drug Binding Kinetics]]
- [[Allosteric Mechanism]] studies
- [[Protein Folding Pathways]]
