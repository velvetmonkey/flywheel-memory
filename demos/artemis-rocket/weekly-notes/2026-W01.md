# [[Week 2026]]-W01

## [[Summary

First]] week of 2026 focused on Q1 [[Sprint Planning]] and [[Test Campaign]] preparation. [[Team]] returned from holidays energized by December's [[Hot Fire Success]]. Kicked off [[Contractor Support]] for [[Flight Software]] development and locked in January [[Test]] schedule.

## Highlights

### [[Major Achievements]]

**Q1 2026 [[Sprint]] Planning**
- ✅ Sprint planning [[Session]] [[Completed]] (January deliverables locked)
- ✅ [[Critical Design Review]] preparation schedule drafted
- ✅ January test campaign [[Scheduled]] (4 [[Tests Planned]])

**[[Flight Software]] [[Acceleration]]**
- ✅ [[Software Contractor]] [[Engagement]] started (2 developers, [[Jan 6]] start)
- ✅ [[Daily Software Standups]] instituted (15-min, [[Focus]] on [[Landing Algorithm]])
- ✅ [[IMU]] buffer fix [[Validated]] in [[Bench Testing]] ([[Ready]] for HIL)

**[[Structures System]] Progress**
- ✅ Airframe welding 75% [[Complete]] (10% progress [[This]] week)
- ✅ [[All]] weld inspections passing ([[Zero]] defects to [[Date]])

### [[Key Decisions]]

1. **[[Test 4]] [[Contingency Plan]]**
   - If [[Turbopump]] [[Not]] delivered by [[Jan 7]], slip Test 4 by 1 week
   - Compress [[CDR Prep]] schedule to maintain [[March 10]] date
   - Budget impact: Minimal ($5K facility rescheduling fee)
   - Decision by: [[Sarah Chen]]

2. **[[Trajectory Optimization]] Descope**
   - Advanced trajectory optimization descoped from v1.0 [[Flight Software]]
   - Keeps [[Landing Algorithm]] achievable with contractor support
   - May revisit for v2.0 after first flight

## Metrics

### Schedule
- [[Project Roadmap]]: Month 8 of 18 (on track)
- [[Critical Design Review]]: 10 weeks away (March 10, 2026)
- First flight: 48 weeks away (December 15, 2026)

### Team
- Team size: 15 people
- Contractors starting: 2 software developers (Jan 6)
- Planned Q1 hires: 3 (manufacturing techs + systems engineer)

### Budget
- Program budget: $14M
- Spent to date: $7.2M (51%)
- Remaining: $6.8M
- Burn [[Rate]]: $1.2M/[[Month]]
- Runway: 5.7 months (through [[June 2026]])
- Assessment: [[On Track]] (fundraising [[Planned]] Q2)

## Risks & Issues

### [[Active Risks]]

**R-003: [[Turbopump Delivery Delay]]** (Score: 15, [[High]])
- Flight unit delayed [[Jan 5]] → [[Jan 20]]
- [[Threatens Test]] 4 schedule ([[Jan 8]])
- Mitigation: Daily supplier tracking, contingency plan approved
- **[[Status]]**: [[Monitoring]] closely, daily calls with [[Acme Aerospace]]

**R-007: [[Flight Software Schedule]]** (Score: 12, MEDIUM)
- [[Landing Algorithm]] complexity higher than estimated
- Contractor support secured ([[Starts Jan]] 6)
- [[Trajectory Optimization]] descoped from v1.0
- **Status**: Daily [[Software]] standups instituted

**R-012: [[Test Facility Availability]]** (Score: 9, MEDIUM)
- Test [[Windows]] reserved through March
- Monitoring for scheduling conflicts
- **Status**: No [[Action Required]]

**R-014: [[Test Facility Scheduling Conflict]]** ([[NEW]], Score: 6, LOW)
- Late January scheduling conflict [[Identified]]
- [[Working]] with facility to [[Secure]] alternate dates
- Impact: 2-3 day slip acceptable
- **Status**: [[Marcus Johnson]] negotiating with facility

### [[New Risks Identified]] This Week
- **R-014**: [[Test Facility]] scheduling conflict ([[See]] above)

## [[Engineering Progress]]

### [[Propulsion System]]
- [[Hot Fire Test]] [[Data Analysis]] ongoing
- Thrust: 182 kN (slightly higher than 180 kN [[Target]] - [[Good]] for payload margin)
- Throttle sweep [[Test Series]] planned for [[Jan 9]]
- [[Marcus Johnson]]: 2 [[Weeks]] ahead of [[Test Campaign Overview]] schedule

### [[Avionics System]]
- [[Flight Computer]] HIL setup planned for [[Jan 10]]
- IMU buffer fix validated (5-[[Sample]] [[Circular Buffer]] working perfectly)
- Cable harness fabrication 80% complete
- [[Software Contractors]] [[Starting Jan]] 6 (2 developers)

### [[Structures System]]
- Airframe welding progress: 75% complete (target: February completion)
- [[Fairing Design]] tooling fabrication: 40% complete
- [[Landing System]] [[Design]] review scheduled [[Jan 15]]

### [[GNC System]]
- [[Landing Algorithm]]: 60% complete (contractor support starting)
- [[Autopilot Software]]: 75% complete
- [[Navigation]] filter (EKF): Complete and validated
- [[Ascent Guidance]]: Complete
- HIL [[Test Planning]]: [[Starts Feb]] 1

## [[Meetings]] & Events

- 12/30: Year-end review meeting
- 12/31: Abbreviated work day, investor [[Report]] submitted
- 01/01: [[Holiday]] (office closed)
- 01/02: Q1 sprint planning, [[Full]] team standup
- 01/03: Scheduled - [[Acme Aerospace]] turbopump status call

## [[Action Items]] for [[Next]] [[Week

1]]. [[Marcus Johnson]]: [[Acme Aerospace]] status call ([[Jan 3]])
2. [[Marcus Johnson]]: Test 4 contingency planning
3. [[Elena Rodriguez]]: Review software contractor SOW (Jan 5)
4. [[Elena Rodriguez]]: Start daily software standups (Jan 3)
5. [[Sarah Chen]]: CDR schedule review (Jan 6)
6. [[James Park]]: [[Landing System]] design review prep (Jan 10 target)

## [[Notes

Strong]] start to 2026. Team energized by December's [[Hot Fire]] success and ready for intense Q1.

**Q1 2026 [[Priorities]]**:
1. **[[Testing]]**: Throttle sweep [[Validation]], avionics [[HIL Integration]]
2. **Fabrication**: Complete airframe welding, start assembly
3. **Software**: Accelerate [[Landing Algorithm]] with contractor support
4. **CDR Prep**: All subsystems to manufacturing-ready maturity

**[[Software Schedule]]** (R-007) remains the #1 [[Technical Risk]]. Contractor support starting Jan 6 will help, [[But]] [[Landing Algorithm]] [[Convex Optimization]] complexity is real. Daily standups will ensure visibility and early [[Detection]] of blockers.

**[[Turbopump Risk]]** (R-003) is #1 [[Program Risk]]. If flight unit doesn't arrive by Jan 7, Test 4 slips 1 week. This is acceptable and has minimal CDR impact. [[Marcus Johnson]] has daily engagement with [[Acme Aerospace]].

**[[Team Morale]]** high [[After]] successful 2025. [[Sarah Chen]]'s year-end review showed [[Strong]] progress and clear 2026 roadmap. Team appreciates transparency on risks and proactive mitigation.

**Investor report** submitted [[Dec 31]] highlighting:
- [[On Schedule]] for [[March 2026]] [[Critical Design Review]]
- Under budget by 3% for 2025
- [[First Hot Fire]] test successful (major validation milestone)
- Team growth proceeding as planned (12 → 15 in 2025, targeting 18 by Q2 2026)
