# Highly accurate protein structure prediction with [[AlphaFold]]

## [[Summary]]

AlphaFold 2 [[Achieved]] near-experimental accuracy in protein structure prediction [[Using]] [[Deep]] [[Learning]]. Revolutionary breakthrough combining attention mechanisms with evolutionary information.

## [[Key Findings]]

- **Accuracy**: Median GDT score of 92.4 on CASP14
- **Method**: Combines MSA [[Processing]] with structure module
- **Impact**: [[Solved 50]]-year protein folding problem

## [[Methodology

Uses]] [[Transformer Architecture]] for [[Multiple Sequence Alignment]] processing. Integrates [[Evolutionary Coupling]] signals with [[Spatial Graph Networks]].

## Relevance to [[My Work

Foundation]] for [[Protein-Ligand Docking]] [[Project]]. Methods directly applicable to [[Structure-Based Drug Design]].
