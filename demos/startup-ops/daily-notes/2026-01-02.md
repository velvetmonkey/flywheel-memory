# 2026-01-02 - [[Customer Success Day]]

## [[Log]]

**09:00** - Call with [[DataDriven Co]] (Sarah)
- Customer: [[DataDriven Co]]
- Topic: Q1 [[Feature]] requests
- Sarah [[Mentioned]] dashboard refresh failures (intermittent)
- **[[Action]]**: Alex to investigate refresh bug (add to [[Feature Priorities]])
- Sarah loves the product, wants alerts ASAP (confirms our Q1 [[Priority]])

**11:30** - [[GrowthStack]] trial check-in
- Customer: [[GrowthStack]]
- Michael asked about SSO [[Timeline]] again
- Trial extended 14 days while we finalize enterprise plan pricing
- **Decision**: If [[They]] convert, SSO moves to P1 (worth $1,999/mo)

**14:00** - Product planning with Alex
- Reviewed User Interview Synthesis - patterns clear
- Confirmed alerts are P0 for Q1 (8/12 interviewees mentioned)
- Scheduled reports can ship later in Q1 (lower urgency)

**16:30** - Updated MRR Tracker
- MRR: $499 ([[DataDriven]] Co [[Only]])
- ARR: $5,988
- Runway: 14 months at [[Current]] burn

## [[Wins]]

- DataDriven Co still happy (renewal [[Risk]]: low)
- GrowthStack trial extended (positive signal)
- Clear product [[Priorities]] for Q1

## Challenges

- [[Only 1]] paying customer ([[Need]] more [[Pipeline]])
- Dashboard refresh bug needs fixing
- SSO blocking enterprise deals

## Tomorrow

- [ ] Draft SSO timeline for GrowthStack
- [ ] [[Review Competitor Analysis]] - update PowerBI section
- [ ] Outreach to 5 manufacturing companies ([[LinkedIn]])

## [[Notes

Good]] day. Customer feedback is gold - Sarah's enthusiasm about alerts confirms we're prioritizing the right things.

Insight: GrowthStack's SSO dependency means we need to accelerate enterprise [[Features]] if we want to move upmarket. [[But]] is that the right move? [[Dec]]-002 says stay SMB-focused. Need to decide if 100-500 employee companies [[Are]] worth chasing or if we stay pure 50-200.

[[Status]]: [[Active]] customers feeling [[Good]], pipeline needs work.
