# Evaluation of off-[[Target]] and on-target [[Scoring]] algorithms

## [[Summary

Systematic]] evaluation of CRISPR [[Guide RNA Design]] [[Tools]]. [[Established]] benchmarks for predicting on-target efficiency and off-target effects.

## [[Key Findings]]

- **Tool comparison**: [[Tested 8]] algorithms on experimental [[Data]]
- **[[Best]] performers**: CFD score for off-targets, [[Doench 2016]] for efficiency
- **[[Design]] principles**: GC content, position-[[Specific]] effects

## Methodology

[[Guide RNA Design]] algorithms [[Using]] [[Sequence Specificity Scoring]]. [[Machine Learning]] models trained on [[CRISPR Screen Data]].

## Relevance to [[My Work

Informs]] [[Gene Knockout Validation]] experiments. Tools [[Used In]] [[sgRNA Design Workflow]].

## [[Applications]]

- [[Therapeutic Gene Editing]]
- [[Functional Genomics Screens]]
