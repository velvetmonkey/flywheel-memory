# Memory Consolidation

Memory consolidation is the process by which newly acquired, fragile memories are transformed into stable, long-term representations. This occurs over hours to days and is strongly dependent on sleep.

## Types of Consolidation

1. **Synaptic consolidation**: Occurs within hours at the cellular level (protein synthesis, receptor changes)
2. **Systems consolidation**: Occurs over weeks to months as memories transfer from hippocampus to neocortex

## Role of Sleep

- NREM (slow-wave) sleep: Replays and strengthens declarative memories (facts, events)
- REM sleep: Integrates memories, supports creative connections, and consolidates procedural skills
- Sleep deprivation disrupts consolidation and impairs [[Working Memory]] next day

## Implications for Learning

- Study before sleep rather than after waking for better retention
- [[Spaced Repetition]] intervals should account for sleep cycles between reviews
- Napping after study can boost consolidation (even 20-minute naps help)
- [[Spacing Effect]] partially works *because* sleep consolidation occurs between sessions

## Connections

- Underpins the [[Spacing Effect]] -- time between sessions allows consolidation
- Sleep consolidation enhances [[Spaced Repetition]] outcomes
- [[Working Memory]] is impaired by poor sleep, increasing [[Cognitive Load Theory]] burden
- Relevant to [[Effective Study Habits]] scheduling recommendations
- [[Transfer of Learning]] benefits from the integrative work of REM sleep
