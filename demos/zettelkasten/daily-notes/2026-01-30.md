# 2026-01-30

## Monthly Review

January was productive for the Zettelkasten. Looking back at the graph:

### Stats
- 10 fleeting notes captured
- 7 literature notes from books
- 18+ permanent notes developed
- 4 active projects underway

### Strongest Clusters
The densest cluster is around **learning techniques**: [[Spaced Repetition]], [[Active Recall]], [[Testing Effect]], [[Desirable Difficulties]], and [[Interleaving]] are all tightly connected. This makes sense -- they're the practical tools.

A second cluster around **cognitive architecture**: [[Working Memory]], [[Cognitive Load Theory]], [[Chunking]], [[Schema Theory]], and [[Dual Coding Theory]]. These are the theoretical foundations.

A third cluster around **motivation**: [[Motivation and Learning]], [[Self-Determination Theory]], [[Growth Mindset]], and [[Flow State]].

### Gaps Identified
- Need more on **neuroscience**: [[Memory Consolidation]] is the only neuroscience-heavy note
- [[Encoding Specificity]] needs more development
- Missing a note on **feedback loops** that could connect [[Formative Assessment]] and [[Deliberate Practice]]

## Project Status
- [[Learning System Design]] -- 60% complete, needs workflow testing
- [[Teaching Methodology Research]] -- 40% complete, good literature coverage
- [[Effective Study Habits]] -- 70% complete, nearly ready for first draft
- [[Curriculum Design for Retention]] -- 30% complete, early stage

## Next Month Focus
- Develop the neuroscience cluster
- Start applying the [[Learning System Design]] to my own study
- Process the [[question-about-sleep-and-memory|sleep and memory question]] into a proper note
