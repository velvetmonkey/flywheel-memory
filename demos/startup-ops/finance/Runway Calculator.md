## Runway Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Status Quo (No Growth)

Monthly burn: $8,300
Cash: $100,000
**Runway: 12 months**

Action required by: Jan 2027

### Scenario 2: First Hire (Q2 2026)

From [[Hiring Plan]]: Engineer at $120K/year = $10K/month

New burn: $18,300/[[Month]]
Remaining cash by Q2: ~$75,000 (3 months of burn)
**Runway after hire: 4 months**

⚠️ **Critical: Must raise seed before Q2 hire**

### Scenario 3: Revenue Growth

If we hit $10K MRR by Q2:
- Revenue: $10,000/month
- Burn: $18,300/month
- [[Net]] burn: $8,300/month
- Runway: Still ~9 months

Still need seed round to hire beyond first engineer.

### Scenario 4: Seed Round Closed

Target: $500K at $3M valuation
If closed Q2 2026:
- Cash: $75K (remaining) + $500K (seed) = $575K
- Burn with 3 hires: $35K/month
- Runway: 16 months (until Jun 2027)
