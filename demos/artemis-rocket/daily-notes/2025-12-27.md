## Tasks

- [x] Conduct [[Hot]] fire test @marcus 📅 2025-12-27
- [x] [[Complete]] post-fire inspection @marcus 📅 2025-12-27
- [x] Update [[Test Results]] [[Documentation]] @marcus 📅 2025-12-27
- [ ] [[Analyze]] [[Sensor Data]] in detail @marcus 📅 2025-12-30
- [ ] Plan next test series (throttle sweep) @marcus 📅 2026-01-03

## [[Notes]]

MAJOR MILESTONE: First full-duration hot fire test of [[Engine Design]] successful! Chamber pressure hit 8.4 MPa (99% of target), [[Specific Impulse]] estimated at 287s (target: 290s, within margin).

[[Turbopump]] performed flawlessly [[Despite]] earlier delivery [[Concerns]]. [[Cooling System]] kept temperatures well within limits. [[Thrust Vector Control]] actuators responded perfectly to test commands.

[[Marcus Johnson]] estimates we're [[Now]] 2 [[Weeks]] ahead of [[Test Campaign Overview]] schedule. [[This]] gives buffer for [[Critical Design Review]] preparation.

Next test: Throttle sweep (25% to 100%) to validate engine controllability for [[Landing Algorithm]].
