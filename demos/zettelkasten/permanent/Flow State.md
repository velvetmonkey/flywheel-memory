# Flow State

Flow is a state of complete absorption in an activity, characterised by deep focus, loss of self-consciousness, and a distorted sense of time. Described by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, it represents the optimal experience of intrinsic [[Motivation and Learning]].

## Conditions for Flow

1. **Clear goals**: Know what you're trying to achieve at each moment
2. **Immediate feedback**: Know whether you're succeeding or failing
3. **Challenge-skill balance**: The task must be neither too easy (boredom) nor too hard (anxiety)

## Flow and Learning

- Flow occurs at the edge of one's abilities -- the same zone targeted by [[Deliberate Practice]]
- In flow, [[Cognitive Load Theory]] resources are fully engaged on the task (germane load maximised, extraneous load eliminated)
- [[Working Memory]] is fully devoted to the task, enabling deep processing
- The intrinsic reward of flow sustains [[Motivation and Learning]] without external incentives

## Limitations

- Flow is not always productive -- it can occur during activities with no learning value
- Beginners rarely experience flow because they lack the [[Schema Theory]] structures to engage smoothly
- Flow can be disrupted by poor environment design or excessive interruptions

## Connections

- Represents peak [[Motivation and Learning]] experience
- [[Deliberate Practice]] targets the challenge-skill sweet spot where flow occurs
- [[Cognitive Load Theory]] explains flow as optimal germane load
- [[Self-Determination Theory]] -- flow satisfies autonomy and competence needs
- [[Working Memory]] engagement during flow enables deep [[Chunking]]
