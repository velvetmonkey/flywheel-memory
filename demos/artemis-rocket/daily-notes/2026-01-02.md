## Risks & Issues

### [[Active Risks]] (from [[Risk Register]])

**R-003: [[Turbopump]] [[Delivery Delay]]** (Score: 15, [[High]])
- Flight unit delayed Jan 5 → Jan 20
- [[Threatens Test]] 4 schedule (Jan 8)
- Mitigation: Daily supplier tracking, expedited shipping arranged
- **Action today**: Approved [[Contingency Plan]] (Test 4 slip if needed)

**R-007: [[Flight Software]] Schedule** (Score: 12, MEDIUM)
- [[Landing Algorithm]] development behind schedule
- Contractor support secured ([[Starts Jan]] 6)
- [[Trajectory Optimization]] descoped from v1.0
- **Action today**: [[Daily Software Standups]] instituted

**R-012: [[Test Facility Availability]]** (Score: 9, MEDIUM)
- [[Test Campaign Overview]] [[Windows]] reserved through March
- [[Monitoring]] for conflicts
- No [[Action Required]] today

### [[New Issues Identified

None]] today.

## [[Schedule Status]]

**[[Overall Program]]**: 🟢 [[On Track]]
- [[Project Roadmap]]: [[Month 8]] of 18
- [[Critical Design Review]]: March 10 (10 [[Weeks]] away)
- [[First]] flight: [[Dec]] 15, 2026 (48 weeks away)

**Near-term Milestones**:
- ⏳ [[Hot Fire Test]] 4 (Jan 8) - **[[AT RISK]]** due to R-003
- ⏳ [[Turbopump]] flight unit delivery (Jan 20)
- ⏳ [[Software Contractors]] start (Jan 6)
- ⏳ [[Landing System]] design review (Jan 15)

## [[Budget Status]]

- Program budget: $14M
- Spent to date: $7.2M (51%)
- Remaining: $6.8M
- Burn rate: $1.2M/[[Month]]
- Runway: 5.7 months (through June)
- **Assessment**: 🟢 ON [[Track]] (first flight [[Dec 2026]])

[[See]] [[Budget Tracker]] for details.

## [[Decisions Made]]

1. **Test 4 [[Contingency Approved]]**
   - If turbopump [[Not]] delivered by [[Jan 7]], slip Test 4 by 1 week
   - Compress CDR prep schedule to maintain March 10 [[Date]]
   - Budget impact: Minimal ($5K test facility rescheduling fee)
   - Decision by: [[Sarah Chen]]

2. **Daily Software Standups**
   - Instituted daily 15-min software team standup
   - [[Focus]] on [[Landing Algorithm]] progress
   - [[Run]] by [[Elena Rodriguez]]
   - Starts Jan 3

## [[Notes]]

**Test 3 Success**: [[Big]] win for the team! 120s burn validates extended-duration [[Performance]]. [[Propulsion System]] design validated at [[This]] duration. Prototype turbopump [[Holding]] up well (3 [[Hot]] fires, minimal wear).

**Software Schedule**: R-007 remains a concern. Contractor support will help, [[But]] [[Landing Algorithm]] complexity is real. [[Trajectory Optimization]] descope was the right call - keeps v1.0 achievable.

**[[Turbopump Risk]]**: R-003 is our #1 program risk right [[Now]]. Daily [[Engagement]] with [[Acme Aerospace]] until resolved. Dual-sourcing with [[Precision Components Inc]] is [[Smart]] long-term hedge.

**[[Team Morale]]**: High [[After]] Test 3 success. Team appreciates transparency on risks (R-003, R-007) and proactive mitigation.
