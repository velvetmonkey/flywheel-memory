## [[Log]]

- 09:00 Weekend work [[Session]] - small [[Team]] [[Only]]
- 09:30 [[Marcus Johnson]] analyzing [[Hot Fire Test]] [[Data]] with [[Propulsion Team]]
- 11:00 [[Elena Rodriguez]] [[Working]] on [[Flight Software]] [[Integration Testing]]
- 13:00 Reviewed [[IMU Selection]] calibration data from [[Sensor Suite]] bench tests
- 14:30 [[James Park]] inspection of welded airframe joints - passing [[All]] NDT [[Checks]]

## Tasks

- [x] [[Complete]] NDT inspection of airframe welds @[[James]] 📅 2025-12-28
- [ ] Upload [[Hot Fire]] [[Test]] [[Video]] to team share @marcus 📅 2025-12-29
- [ ] Schedule [[Avionics Integration Test]] for January @elena 📅 2025-12-30

## [[Notes

Productive]] weekend session [[Despite]] skeleton crew. [[James Park]] reports all weld X-ray inspections passed with [[Zero]] defects - [[This]] is exceptional quality for [[Airframe Design]] [[Production]].

[[Elena Rodriguez]] discovered timing issue between [[Flight Computer]] and [[IMU Selection]] - 400 Hz [[IMU]] data occasionally missing samples at 1000 Hz [[Control Loop Rate]]. Working on buffer [[Strategy]] to handle this gracefully.

[[Engine Hot Fire Results]] preliminary analysis [[Shows]] thrust slightly higher than predicted (182 kN vs 180 kN [[Target]]). This is [[Good]] [[News]] for [[Payload Capacity]] margin.
