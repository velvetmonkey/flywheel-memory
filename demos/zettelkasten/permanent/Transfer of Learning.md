# Transfer of Learning

Transfer of learning is the ability to apply knowledge or skills learned in one context to new, different contexts. It is the ultimate goal of education -- not just knowing facts but being able to use them flexibly.

## Types of Transfer

- **Near transfer**: Applying learning to similar contexts (e.g., solving similar math problems)
- **Far transfer**: Applying learning to very different contexts (e.g., using chess strategy in business)
- Far transfer is much harder to achieve and may require explicit instruction in when and how to transfer

## What Promotes Transfer

- Abstract [[Schema Theory]] representations (principles over procedures)
- Practice in varied contexts (see [[Interleaving]] and [[Desirable Difficulties]])
- [[Elaborative Interrogation]] to extract underlying principles
- [[Metacognition]] to recognise when a previously learned strategy applies
- [[Deliberate Practice]] with diverse problem types

## What Hinders Transfer

- Surface-level learning (memorising steps without understanding)
- Context-dependent encoding (see [[Encoding Specificity]])
- Lack of practice variety (blocked practice teaches only one context)

## Connections

- [[Interleaving]] builds the flexible discrimination needed for transfer
- [[Schema Theory]] -- abstract schemas transfer better than specific procedures
- [[Elaborative Interrogation]] extracts transferable principles
- [[Metacognition]] helps recognise transfer opportunities
- Central goal of [[Learning System Design]] project
