# [[Week 2025]]-W52

## [[Summary

Final]] week of 2025 marked by successful [[Engine]] [[Hot Fire Test]] and [[Team]] wind-down for holidays. Major milestone [[Achieved]] with [[First]] [[Full]]-duration burn validating [[Engine Design]]. [[Team Morale]] [[Excellent]] heading into Q1 2026.

## Highlights

### [[Major Achievements]]

**[[Propulsion System]] - [[Hot Fire Success]]**
- ✅ First full-duration (12 second) [[Hot Fire]] [[Test]] - SUCCESSFUL
- [[Chamber Pressure]]: 8.4 MPa (99% of [[Target]])
- [[Specific Impulse]]: 287s (within margin of 290s target)
- [[Turbopump]] performed flawlessly [[Despite]] earlier delivery [[Concerns]]
- [[Cooling System]] temperatures nominal throughout burn
- No anomalies observed in post-fire inspection

**[[Structures System]] - [[Fabrication Progress]]**
- ✅ Airframe welding 60% [[Complete]] (ahead of schedule)
- [[All]] weld X-ray inspections passed with [[Zero]] defects
- [[Landing System]] [[Carbon Fiber]] material approved

**[[Avionics System]] - [[Software Fix]]**
- ✅ [[Flight Computer]] [[IMU]] buffer issue resolved
- 5-[[Sample]] [[Circular Buffer]] [[Implemented]] in [[Flight Software]]
- [[Ensures 1000]] Hz [[Autopilot Software]] always has fresh [[Sensor Data]]

### [[Key Decisions]]

1. **[[Risk Register]] Update**
   - R-003 ([[Turbopump Delivery Delay]]) closed [[After]] successful test
   - [[Turbopump]] delivery concerns resolved

2. [[Material Selection]]
   - [[Carbon]] [[Fiber]] approved for [[Landing System]] legs
   - Expected mass savings critical for reusability

## Metrics

### Schedule
- [[Project Roadmap]]: [[Month 8]] of 18 ([[On Track]])
- [[Critical Design Review]]: 11 [[Weeks]] away ([[March 2026]])
- [[Test Campaign]]: 2 weeks ahead of schedule after [[Hot]] fire success

### Team
- [[Team Size]]: 15 people
- Attendance: Reduced during holidays (12/25-12/26)
- Morale: [[High]] after [[Test Success]]

### Budget
- Q4 came in 3% under budget
- Hot fire test within allocated budget
- No overruns despite turbopump expediting

## Risks & Issues

### Closed [[This]] Week
- **R-003**: Turbopump [[Delivery Delay]] - CLOSED (part delivered and tested [[Successfully]])

### [[Active Risks]]
- **R-007**: [[Flight Software]] schedule (MEDIUM)
- **R-012**: [[Test Facility]] availability (LOW)

### [[New Risks Identified]]
- [[None]] this week

## [[Engineering Progress]]

### [[Propulsion System]]
- Hot fire [[Test 3]]: Full success
- [[Engine Hot Fire Results]] [[Documented]]
- [[Next]] [[Test Series]] [[Planned]]: Throttle sweep (25-100%)
- [[Marcus Johnson]] estimates 2 weeks ahead of schedule

### [[Avionics System]]
- [[Flight Computer]] [[Integration Testing]] ongoing
- IMU sampling buffer implemented (fixed timing issue)
- [[Elena Rodriguez]] preparing for January HIL tests

### [[Structures System]]
- Airframe TIG welding: 60% → 75% complete
- All NDT inspections passing
- [[James Park]] confident in February assembly start

### [[GNC System]]
- [[Landing Algorithm]] simulations: 96% [[Success Rate]]
- [[Autopilot Software]] [[Integration]] [[Testing]]
- Preparing for [[HIL Validation]] in January

## [[Meetings]] & Events

- 12/23: [[Morning]] standup, propulsion review
- 12/24: Abbreviated standup ([[Holiday]] week)
- 12/27: Hot fire test + celebration
- 12/30: Year-end review meeting (full team)

## [[Action Items]] for Next [[Week

1]]. [[Marcus Johnson]]: [[Analyze]] hot fire [[Test Data]] in detail
2. [[Marcus Johnson]]: Plan throttle sweep test series
3. [[Elena Rodriguez]]: Schedule avionics [[HIL Testing]] for [[January
4]]. [[James Park]]: Complete thermal TPS specification review
5. [[Sarah Chen]]: Draft Q1 2026 [[Sprint]] plan

## [[Notes

Exceptional]] end to 2025. The successful hot fire test validates months of [[Design]] and analysis work on [[Engine Design]]. Team deserved the holiday break after this [[Achievement]].

[[Sarah Chen]]'s year-end review highlighted [[Strong]] progress:
- [[Preliminary Design Review]] [[Completed]]
- [[Engine Design]] [[Validated]]
- [[Airframe Fabrication]] well underway
- [[Avionics Integration]] started

Looking ahead to Q1 2026 with momentum. [[Focus Areas]]:
1. [[Complete Test]] campaign (throttle sweep, [[Integration Tests]])
2. Finish airframe fabrication and assembly
3. Accelerate [[Flight Software]] development with [[Contractor Support]]
4. Prepare for [[Critical Design Review]] (March 2026)
