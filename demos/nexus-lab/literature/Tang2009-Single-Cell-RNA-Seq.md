# mRNA-Seq whole-transcriptome analysis of a single cell

## [[Summary

First]] demonstration of RNA-Seq at single-cell resolution. Opened new field of single-cell transcriptomics revealing cell-to-cell heterogeneity.

## [[Key Findings]]

- **Single-cell resolution**: Transcriptome from [[One]] mouse blastomere
- **Sensitivity**: [[Detected 75]]% of known transcripts
- **Heterogeneity**: Revealed expression variability in "identical" cells

## [[Methodology

Builds]] on [[Mortazavi2008-RNA-Seq]] with [[Single-Cell Isolation]] and [[Whole Transcriptome Amplification]].

## Relevance to [[My Work

Core]] method for [[Single-Cell RNA-Seq Analysis]] [[Project]]. [[Protocol]] adapted in [[Experiment-2024-11-15]].

## [[Related Work]]

- Extends [[Mortazavi2008-RNA-Seq]]
- Led to [[10x Genomics Platform]]
- [[Used In]] [[Cell-Type-Classification]]
