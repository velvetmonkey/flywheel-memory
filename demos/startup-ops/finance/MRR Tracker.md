- 10 customers at $999/mo (Enterprise plan), OR
- Mix: 5 Enterprise + 10 Professional = $9,990

**Current Pace:**
- 1 customer in 2 months = 0.5/month
- At this rate: 20 months to $10K
- **[[Need]] to accelerate sales**

- Demos booked: 8 ([[Dec]]-Jan)
- Trials started: 3
- Trial → Paid conversion: 33% (1/3)
- Churn [[Rate]]: 50% (1/2 paid customers churned)

**[[Unit Economics]]:**
