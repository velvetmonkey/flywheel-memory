## Notes

Validation is now at 90% - should complete next week. Performance results are solid - client will be happy.

The playbook review surfaced several outdated sections. The cloud migration patterns section is from 2023 and doesn't reflect current best practices. Adding to my task list.

Friday planning note: Next week is critical for TechStart proposal decision. Need to be responsive if Mike has questions.
