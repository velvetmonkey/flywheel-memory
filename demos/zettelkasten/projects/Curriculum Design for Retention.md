# Curriculum Design for Retention

Design a curriculum framework that embeds cognitive science principles into the structure itself, ensuring that retention and transfer are built in rather than left to student initiative.

## Design Principles

### Spacing Built Into the Schedule
- Revisit each topic at expanding intervals across the semester (applying [[Spacing Effect]])
- Homework sets include problems from previous weeks ([[Spaced Repetition]] at the curriculum level)
- Cumulative assessments rather than unit-only tests

### Interleaved Practice
- Each problem set mixes current and past topics ([[Interleaving]])
- Students must discriminate which strategy to use -- building [[Transfer of Learning]] skills
- Contrast with traditional blocked chapter-end exercises

### Retrieval-Based Activities
- Start each class with a brief no-stakes quiz ([[Testing Effect]])
- Use think-pair-share for [[Active Recall]] in groups
- [[Formative Assessment]] integrated into every lesson

### Managing Cognitive Load
- Sequence topics from simple to complex ([[Cognitive Load Theory]])
- Provide worked examples early, fade scaffolding as [[Schema Theory]] develops
- Use [[Dual Coding Theory]] in all instructional materials

### Motivational Architecture
- Build in autonomy through topic choice ([[Self-Determination Theory]])
- Celebrate growth and effort ([[Growth Mindset]])
- Design for [[Flow State]] by matching challenge to skill progression
- Address [[Motivation and Learning]] explicitly in orientation

## Assessment Strategy

- Frequent low-stakes quizzes (testing effect + formative feedback)
- Portfolio of [[Elaborative Interrogation]] explanations
- Final assessment emphasises [[Transfer of Learning]] to novel contexts
- [[Metacognition]] reflections as graded components

## Connections

- Sub-project of [[Teaching Methodology Research]]
- Shares principles with [[Learning System Design]] (student perspective)
- [[Effective Study Habits]] guide complements this from the learner side
- [[Deliberate Practice]] informs how practice activities should be structured
- [[Chunking]] guides how content modules are sized
- [[Memory Consolidation]] informs class scheduling (avoid back-to-back sessions on same topic)
