# TKT-2024-002: API Authentication Help

## Issue

[[Bob Wilson]] couldn't authenticate API requests. Getting 401 errors.

## Context

- New developer customer
- First time using our API
- Building SaaS integration

## Resolution

1. Identified issue: Using API key in query param instead of header
2. Sent correct curl example
3. Bob confirmed working

```bash
# Incorrect (what Bob was doing)
curl https://api.example.com/v1/data?api_key=xxx

# Correct
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer xxx" https://api.example.com/v1/data
```
