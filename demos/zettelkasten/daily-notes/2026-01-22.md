# 2026-01-22

## Reading Session

Finished [[A Mind for Numbers]] today. Barbara Oakley's distinction between focused and diffuse modes is fascinating. It maps surprisingly well onto Kahneman's System 1/System 2 from [[Thinking Fast and Slow]], though the contexts are different.

The chapter on [[Chunking]] was the highlight. Her claim that "chunking is the mother of all learning" is bold but well-supported. I've updated my [[Chunking]] permanent note with her examples.

## Fleeting Captures

- [[note-on-flow-state|Note on flow state]] -- the challenge/skill balance idea
- [[wonder-about-chunking|Wonder about chunking]] -- are experts just better chunkers?

## Spaced Repetition Review

Did my scheduled review of [[Working Memory]], [[Cognitive Load Theory]], and [[Schema Theory]] notes. All three felt solid. The connections between them are becoming automatic -- I think my own schemas for these concepts are maturing.

## Project Updates

Made progress on [[Curriculum Design for Retention]] -- drafted the section on spacing built into the schedule.
