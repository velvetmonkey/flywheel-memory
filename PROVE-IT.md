## 7. Cross-Archetype Comparison

| Archetype | Precision | Recall | F1 | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| hub-and-spoke | 11.1% | 12.5% | 11.8% | Three dominant hub notes (ESGHub, TypeScript, David Chen) with 15+ backlinks each, surrounded by 60 spoke notes with 1-2 outlinks. Tests hub boost (Layer 9), power-law detection, and orphan reduction. |
| hierarchical | 34.6% | 75.0% | 47.4% | Strict 4-level hierarchy: 1 root -> 4 L2 departments -> 16 L3 teams -> 59 leaf notes. Only parent-to-child links exist. Tests cross-level linking, depth navigation, and bridge discovery. |
| dense-mesh | 13.5% | 33.3% | 19.2% | 5 clusters of 10 notes each, internally fully connected (45 links per cluster = 225 total internal links), zero inter-cluster links. Tests over-connection detection, suggestion restraint, and precision under high density. |
| sparse-orphan | 18.0% | 29.0% | 22.2% | 99 notes with 40 orphans (0 links), 30 loosely connected (1-2 links), and 30 moderately connected (3-5 links). Entity mentions appear in content but are not linked. Tests orphan reduction rate, entity coverage from near-zero, and cold-start scenarios. |
| bridge-network | 32.0% | 32.0% | 32.0% | 80 notes: 5 clusters of 12 notes each (60 total), 5 bridge notes connecting adjacent clusters, and 15 isolated notes. Tests bridge note emergence, betweenness centrality growth, and cluster merging via new wikilink suggestions. |
| small-world | 68.8% | 73.3% | 71.0% | 100 notes with small-world topology: high clustering (0.3+) with low avg path length (<3.0). Notes form a ring lattice with random rewiring. Tests path length maintenance, clustering preservation, and realistic PKM structure. |

## 11. Methodology

- All tests deterministic (fixed seeds)
- Ground truth links are stripped from notes before testing; the engine must rediscover them
- Precision = true positives / total suggestions
- Recall = true positives / total ground truth
- F1 = harmonic mean of precision and recall
- MRR = mean reciprocal rank of first correct suggestion per note
- Layer ablation: each scoring layer disabled individually; F1 delta measures contribution
- Scoring layers (12): length_filter, article_filter, exact_match, stem_match, cooccurrence, type_boost, context_boost, recency, cross_folder, hub_boost, feedback, semantic
- Run: `npm run test:quality:report`
- Engine: flywheel-memory v2.0.34
