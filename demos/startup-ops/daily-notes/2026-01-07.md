# 2026-01-07 - [[Investor Call]] & [[Day 2]] Check-in

## [[Log]]

**09:30** - [[DataDriven Co]] Day 2 check-in
- Playbook: [[Customer Onboarding]]
- Sarah connected second [[Data]] source ([[Quality Metrics]])
- Tom [[Created]] 3 more dashboards on his own ([[Good]] [[Sign]] - product is intuitive)
- **Issue**: Dashboard refresh failed twice yesterday (confirms bug)
- [[Action]]: Alex prioritizing fix [[This]] week

**11:00** - Product sync with Alex
- [[Added]] "Dashboard refresh bug" to [[Feature Priorities]] as P1
- Discussed alerts [[Timeline]] - [[Feb 28]] [[Target]] still realistic
- Reviewed [[Caching Layer]] [[Performance]] - shipped [[Jan 25]], [[Working Well]]

**16:00** - Investor call ([[Velocity Ventures]])
- Meeting: [[2026-01-07 Investor Call]]
- Attendees: Jamie, [[Priya Sharma]] (Partner), [[Michael Torres]] (Associate)
- Deck went well - [[They]] like the [[SMB Focus]] and fast time-to-[[Value]]
- [[Concerns]]: [[Only 1]] paying customer ([[Need]] more proof)
- [[Next]]: They'll intro us to 2 portfolio companies for trials

**17:30** - [[Updated Investor Pipeline]]
- Finance: [[Investor Pipeline]]
- [[Velocity]] Ventures moved to "[[Intro Call Complete]]"
- Next step: Portfolio intros (this week)

## [[Wins]]

- [[DataDriven]] Co [[Using]] product heavily (Tom created 3 dashboards solo)
- Velocity Ventures warm (portfolio intros = [[Validation]])
- Dashboard bug [[Prioritized]]

## Challenges

- Dashboard refresh bug is impacting DataDriven Co experience
- Investor concern about single customer is valid (need [[Pipeline]])
- [[GrowthStack]] decision still pending (supposed to be [[Friday]])

## [[Action Items]]

- [ ] Follow up with GrowthStack on Friday (decision timeline)
- [ ] [[Send Velocity Ventures]] portfolio intro thank [[You]]
- [ ] Alex: Fix dashboard refresh bug by EOW
- [ ] Jamie: Outreach to manufacturing prospects (5 companies)

## [[Notes

Solid]] day. Velocity Ventures is interested, [[But]] Priya's right - 1 customer isn't enough proof. We need 3-5 paying customers to raise a seed round.

DataDriven Co is becoming a case study - perfect ICP fit, fast onboarding, already creating value. Need to clone this success 10x.

Dashboard bug is concerning. If we lose DataDriven Co's trust early, [[Churn Risk]] increases. Alex is on it.

Playbooks [[Are]] [[Working]]: [[Customer Onboarding]] checklist kept us [[On Track]] for Day 2 check-in. [[Weekly Metrics Review]] helped prep for investor call.

[[Status]]: [[Building]] momentum
