# How We Learn

## Key Ideas

- Forgetting is not the enemy of learning -- it actually aids learning through the [[Spacing Effect]]
- Context variation during study (different rooms, times) strengthens retrieval cues
- [[Interleaving]] forces the brain to discriminate between problem types, building flexible knowledge
- Sleep is a "learning aid" -- [[Memory Consolidation]] restructures memories during rest
- Distraction can sometimes benefit creative problem-solving (diffuse thinking)

## Quotes

> "Forgetting is the friend of learning."

> "A change of scenery... can enhance recall and deepen learning."

## Connections

- Builds on the [[Testing Effect]] research from Roediger's lab
- Context-dependent memory relates to [[Encoding Specificity]]
- The forgetting paradox connects to [[Spaced Repetition]] design
- Creativity section ties into [[Flow State]] and incubation periods
- Feeds into [[Effective Study Habits]] project recommendations
