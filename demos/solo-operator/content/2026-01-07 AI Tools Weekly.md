## Content

Hey,

I've been using Claude Code as my "chief of staff" for 3 months now.

Here are the 5 workflows that actually save me time:

### 1. Morning Briefing

Every morning, I type `/briefing` and Claude:
- Summarizes yesterday's notes
- Checks my content calendar
- Reviews my revenue tracker
- Gives me a 3-bullet action plan

**Time saved**: 15 min/day

### 2. Newsletter Prep

Before each issue, Claude:
- Pulls relevant notes from the week
- Finds past issues on similar topics
- Drafts an outline based on my voice

**Time saved**: 45 min/issue

### 3. Revenue Dashboard

"How's revenue this month?" pulls data from:
- Course sales
- Consulting hours
- Sponsor payments

No spreadsheet needed.

**Time saved**: 30 min/week

### 4. Weekly Review

Every Sunday, I ask Claude to create a weekly summary:
- Aggregates daily notes
- Calculates metrics
- Highlights achievements

**Time saved**: 1 hour/week

### 5. Content Ideas

When I'm stuck: "What should I write about based on my recent notes?"

Claude scans my daily logs for patterns and suggests topics.

**Time saved**: Incalculable (creative block is expensive)

---

The secret isn't the AI. It's the **system** - structured markdown files that Claude can actually work with.

I'm building a free guide on how to set this up. Reply "SYSTEM" if you want early access.
