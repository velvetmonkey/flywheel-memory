# 2026-01-01 - New Year Planning

## Goals for 2026

### Q1 [[Priorities]]
- **Ship [[Caching Layer]]** - [[Performance]] fix for larger datasets ([[InsightHub]] lesson)
- **Add alerts & notifications** - [[Top]] customer request from [[DataDriven Co]]
- **[[Close 5]] new customers** - [[Target]]: 50-200 employee SMBs

### [[Annual Goals]]
- **Revenue**: $50K MRR by EOY (currently $500)
- **Customers**: 80+ paying (currently 1)
- **[[Team]]**: Hire [[First]] [[Engineer]] (Q2), first sales hire (Q3)
- **Product**: [[Feature]] parity with [[Mid]]-tier competitors (alerts, SSO, RBAC)

## Reflections on 2025

**[[What]] worked:**
- [[Focus]] on SMB [[Market]] - [[DataDriven]] Co is perfect fit
- $499 pricing - sweet spot confirmed
- Fast setup (30 min) - [[Key]] differentiator vs Tableau

**[[What Didn]]'t:**
- InsightHub churn - we tried to serve [[High]]-volume [[Data]] before [[Ready]]
- Too slow on alerts feature - [[Should]] [[Have]] [[Prioritized]] earlier
- No outbound sales motion - Jamie doing [[Everything]] manually

**Lessons:**
- Stick to ICP (50-200 employees, <1M rows)
- Ship customer requests [[Faster]] (3+ asks = P1)
- [[Don]]'t chase [[Big]] deals if [[They]] don't fit product maturity

## [[Action Items]]

- [ ] Review [[Q1 2026 Roadmap]] with Alex - sync on priorities
- [ ] Update investor deck with 2025 metrics
- [ ] Schedule customer check-ins (DataDriven Co, [[GrowthStack]])
- [ ] Draft [[Hiring Plan]] for Q1 engineer role

## [[Notes]]

New Year, new focus. 2025 was about proving the concept. 2026 is about scaling what works.

Key insight from yesterday's reflection: We can't be everything to everyone. Better to be the [[Best]] analytics tool for 50-200 person SMBs than a mediocre option for everyone.
