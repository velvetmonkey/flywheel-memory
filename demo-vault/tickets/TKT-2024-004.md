# TKT-2024-004: Rate Limit Question

## Issue

[[Bob Wilson]] asking about [[API Rate Limits]] for his integration.

## Context

- Developer tier (1000 req/min)
- Building SaaS that may need higher limits
- Considering enterprise upgrade

## Conversation

**Bob:** "I'm building a real-time dashboard. Will I hit rate limits with 100 users?"

**Analysis:**
- 100 users × 1 req/sec = 6000 req/min
- Developer tier: 1000 req/min ❌
- Enterprise tier: 10000 req/min ✓

## Recommended Response

Suggest enterprise tier or implement client-side caching to reduce API calls.
