# Cognitive Load Theory

Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), developed by John Sweller, posits that learning is constrained by the limited capacity of [[Working Memory]]. Instructional design should minimise unnecessary demands on working memory to free resources for actual learning.

## Three Types of Load

1. **Intrinsic load** -- inherent difficulty of the material; determined by element interactivity
2. **Extraneous load** -- caused by poor instructional design; should be minimised
3. **Germane load** -- effort devoted to building and automating [[Schema Theory]] structures; should be maximised

## Implications for Learning

- [[Chunking]] reduces intrinsic load by packaging related elements together
- [[Dual Coding Theory]] can reduce load by distributing processing across verbal and visual channels
- Expertise reversal effect: scaffolding that helps novices can hinder experts (redundancy)
- [[Worked Example Effect]] -- studying worked examples is more effective for novices than problem-solving

## Design Principles

- Split attention effect: integrate text and diagrams rather than separating them
- Modality effect: use both auditory and visual channels
- Redundancy effect: remove unnecessary duplication

## Connections

- [[Working Memory]] capacity is the bottleneck CLT addresses
- [[Chunking]] is the primary strategy for managing intrinsic load
- [[Dual Coding Theory]] provides a mechanism for distributing load
- [[Schema Theory]] explains how germane load builds long-term knowledge
- Informs [[Teaching Methodology Research]] curriculum design
