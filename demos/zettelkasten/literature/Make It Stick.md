# Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning

## Key Ideas

- Learning that feels easy is often superficial; effective learning requires effort
- [[Active Recall]] is far superior to passive re-reading for long-term retention
- [[Spaced Repetition]] exploits the [[Spacing Effect]] to cement knowledge over time
- [[Interleaving]] mixed practice outperforms blocked practice even though it feels harder
- [[Elaborative Interrogation]] -- generating explanations for facts -- deepens understanding
- The concept of [[Desirable Difficulties]] explains why harder practice leads to better outcomes

## Quotes

> "Learning is deeper and more durable when it's effortful."

> "Retrieval practice -- recalling facts or concepts or events from memory -- is a more effective learning strategy than review by rereading."

## Connections

- Central thesis aligns with the [[Testing Effect]] research
- Chapter on illusions of knowing relates to [[Metacognition]] and the [[Dunning-Kruger Effect]]
- The authors argue against massed practice, supporting the [[Spacing Effect]]
- Provides practical examples that feed into [[Learning System Design]]
