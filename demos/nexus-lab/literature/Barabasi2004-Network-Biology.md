# Network biology: understanding the cell's functional organization

## [[Summary

Comprehensive]] review establishing network analysis as fundamental tool for understanding cellular [[Systems]]. Introduced scale-free network properties in biological contexts.

## [[Key Concepts]]

- **Scale-free networks**: Power-law degree distribution in protein interactions
- **Hub proteins**: Highly connected nodes [[Are]] disease-critical
- **Network motifs**: Recurring regulatory circuits

## Methodology

[[Graph Theory]] applied to [[Protein-Protein Interaction Networks]]. Introduced [[Centrality Measures]] for biological importance.

## Relevance to [[My Work

Theoretical]] foundation for [[PPI Network Analysis]]. [[Centrality Measures]] [[Implemented]] in [[Experiment-2024-11-18]].

## [[Applications]]

- [[Network Pharmacology]]
- [[Gene Regulatory Networks]]
- [[Used In]] [[Protein-Interaction-Map]] [[Project]]
