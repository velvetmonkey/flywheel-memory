# Self-Determination Theory

Self-Determination Theory (SDT), developed by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan, is a macro-theory of human motivation that identifies three innate psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. When these needs are satisfied, intrinsic motivation flourishes.

## The Three Needs

1. **Autonomy**: The need to feel that one's actions are self-endorsed and volitional
2. **Competence**: The need to feel effective and capable of achieving desired outcomes
3. **Relatedness**: The need to feel connected to and cared for by others

## Motivation Continuum

SDT describes a spectrum from amotivation through extrinsic motivation (external, introjected, identified, integrated) to intrinsic motivation. Education should aim to move students toward more internalised forms of motivation.

## Implications for Education

- Give learners choice (autonomy) -- let them select topics, methods, or pace
- Provide optimal challenge and feedback (competence) -- aligns with [[Deliberate Practice]]
- Foster collaborative learning environments (relatedness)
- Avoid controlling language and excessive surveillance

## Connections

- Provides the theoretical foundation for understanding [[Motivation and Learning]]
- Competence need connects to [[Growth Mindset]] -- belief that competence can grow
- [[Flow State]] occurs when competence and challenge are balanced
- [[Metacognition]] supports autonomous self-regulation of learning
- Informs [[Teaching Methodology Research]] classroom design
- [[Formative Assessment]] supports competence by providing actionable feedback
