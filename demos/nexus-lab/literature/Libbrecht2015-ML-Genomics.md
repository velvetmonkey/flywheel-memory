# [[Machine Learning]] [[Applications]] in genetics and genomics

## [[Summary

Survey]] of [[Machine]] [[Learning]] methods for genomic [[Data Analysis]]. Covers supervised, unsupervised, and [[Deep Learning]] approaches with practical considerations.

## [[Key Methods]]

- **Supervised**: [[Random Forests]] for variant classification
- **Unsupervised**: [[Dimensionality Reduction]] for expression [[Data]]
- **[[Deep]] Learning**: [[Convolutional Neural Networks]] for sequence motifs

## Methodology

[[Feature Engineering]] for genomic data. [[Cross-Validation]] strategies for genomic datasets with linkage disequilibrium.

## Relevance to [[My Work
