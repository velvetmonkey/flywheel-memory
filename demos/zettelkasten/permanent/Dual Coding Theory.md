# Dual Coding Theory

Allan Paivio's Dual Coding Theory proposes that the brain processes information through two distinct but interconnected channels: a **verbal** system (words, language) and a **non-verbal/imagery** system (pictures, spatial representations).

## Core Claims

- Information encoded in both channels is remembered better than information in only one
- The two systems are independent but can activate each other (e.g., seeing the word "dog" can evoke a mental image)
- Concrete concepts benefit more from dual coding because they are easily imaged

## Implications for Learning

- Combining text with relevant diagrams strengthens encoding (see [[Cognitive Load Theory]] modality effect)
- Sketchnoting, concept maps, and visual note-taking leverage dual coding
- [[Working Memory]] has separate stores for verbal and visual information -- dual coding distributes load

## Limitations

- Not all information is easily visualised (abstract concepts)
- Poorly designed visuals can increase [[Cognitive Load Theory]] rather than reduce it (redundancy effect)
- The "learning styles" myth (visual vs. auditory learners) is NOT supported by dual coding research

## Connections

- Complements [[Cognitive Load Theory]] by explaining *how* to distribute processing load
- Leverages the separate subsystems in [[Working Memory]] (Baddeley's model)
- Effective dual coding requires [[Chunking]] of visual information
- Informs [[Teaching Methodology Research]] multimedia design
- Supports [[Elaborative Interrogation]] when combined with diagramming
