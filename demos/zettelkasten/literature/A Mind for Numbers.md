# A Mind for Numbers

## Key Ideas

- The brain alternates between **focused mode** and **diffuse mode** during learning
- [[Chunking]] is the process of grouping information into compact, meaningful units
- Procrastination is driven by pain avoidance -- the Pomodoro technique helps overcome it
- [[Working Memory]] has severe capacity limits (~4 items); [[Chunking]] expands effective capacity
- Sleep plays a critical role in [[Memory Consolidation]] -- the brain rehearses patterns overnight
- [[Deliberate Practice]] requires focused attention on weaknesses, not just repetition

## Quotes

> "Chunking is the mother of all learning."

> "Understanding is like a superglue that holds underlying memory traces together."

## Connections

- The focused/diffuse mode framework relates to [[Flow State]] and optimal challenge
- Chunking discussion deepens understanding of [[Cognitive Load Theory]]
- Oakley's emphasis on practice connects to [[Transfer of Learning]]
- Sleep and memory section informs [[Memory Consolidation]] research
- Useful source for [[Effective Study Habits]] project
