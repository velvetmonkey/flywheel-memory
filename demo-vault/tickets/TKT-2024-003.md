- Previous [[Billing]] issues (see [[TKT-2024-001]])

## Investigation

- Confirmed duplicate charge in Stripe
- Caused by retry logic bug after failed webhook
- Engineering notified

## Current Status

- Escalated to billing team
- Refund initiated ($99)

## Notes

Sarah explicitly said "if this happens again, I'm switching providers." High churn risk. Flagged for account manager follow-up.
