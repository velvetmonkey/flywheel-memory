## Notes

**Newsletter performance**: 42% open rate - highest since I started! The "5 Workflows" angle crushed it. Subject line: "5 Claude Code workflows that save me 10 hours/week". Numbers + specific outcome = opens.

**Course sale**: $297 from newsletter CTA with CLAUDE10 discount (10% off). Customer email said they'd been reading for 3 months before buying. Long consideration cycles are normal.

**TechCorp session**: Great session. Audited their current workflow, identified 3 quick wins. They want to book a 4-session package to implement. That would be $2,400 - biggest consulting deal yet.

**Subscriber growth idea**: What if I offered the TechCorp case study as a lead magnet? "How a 50-person team implemented AI workflows" - could drive signups.
