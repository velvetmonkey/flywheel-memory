# Growth Mindset

Carol Dweck's growth mindset is the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication, effort, and learning. It contrasts with a fixed mindset -- the belief that talents are innate and immutable.

## Impact on Learning

- Growth mindset students interpret difficulty as a signal to try harder, not as evidence of limitation
- They embrace [[Desirable Difficulties]] rather than avoiding them
- Failure is treated as informative feedback rather than identity-defining judgment
- They are more likely to use effective strategies like [[Active Recall]] and [[Spaced Repetition]]

## Developing Growth Mindset

- Praise process (effort, strategy, persistence) rather than traits ("you're so smart")
- Model learning from mistakes publicly
- Teach the neuroscience of neuroplasticity -- the brain physically changes with learning
- Use "yet" framing: "I can't do this *yet*"

## Criticisms and Nuance

- Effect sizes in replications are smaller than originally reported
- Mindset interventions alone are insufficient without systemic support
- "Growth mindset" can become toxic positivity if effort is praised regardless of strategy quality -- [[Metacognition]] must guide effort

## Connections

- Prerequisite for engaging with [[Desirable Difficulties]]
- Supports sustained [[Deliberate Practice]] through frustration
- [[Self-Determination Theory]] provides complementary motivational framework
- [[Metacognition]] ensures growth mindset doesn't become "effort for effort's sake"
- [[Motivation and Learning]] explores the broader motivational landscape
