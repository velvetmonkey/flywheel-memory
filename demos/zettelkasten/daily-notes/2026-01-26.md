## Key Insight

Had a breakthrough while reading [[Peak]] today: [[Deliberate Practice]] isn't just about putting in hours -- it's about the *quality* of attention during those hours. The mental representations Ericsson describes are essentially expert-level [[Schema Theory]] structures built through focused [[Chunking]].

This connects to [[Flow State]] too -- deliberate practice and flow share the requirement of operating at the edge of ability. But they're not identical: deliberate practice is often uncomfortable, while flow is inherently enjoyable.

## Fleeting Notes Processed

- Promoted [[idea-testing-as-learning|idea about testing as learning]] into the [[Testing Effect]] permanent note
- [[hunch-about-elaboration|Hunch about elaboration]] is now integrated into [[Elaborative Interrogation]]
- [[question-about-motivation|Question about motivation]] needs more research before promotion

## Sleep and Study

After reading [[Why We Sleep]], I've restructured my study schedule. Now doing the heaviest learning material in the evening before bed to leverage [[Memory Consolidation]]. Morning sessions are for review ([[Active Recall]]) of material studied the previous night.

## Tomorrow

- Continue [[Learning System Design]] project
- Process remaining fleeting notes
- Start [[Mindset]] literature note
