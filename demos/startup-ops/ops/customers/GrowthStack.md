## [[Use Case]]

GrowthStack is a [[Project]] [[Management]] SaaS with 120 employees. [[They]] [[Need]]:
- Product usage analytics
- Customer health [[Scoring]]
- Churn prediction models

Currently [[Using]] a patchwork of [[Tools]] (Mixpanel + Tableau + [[Custom]] [[Scripts]]).

## [[Decision Criteria

Michael]]'s evaluation checklist:
- [ ] [[API]] [[Integration]] with their Postgres warehouse ([[In Progress]])
- [ ] Custom dashboard templates (Alex [[Working]] on it)
- [ ] SSO / SAML auth (Q2 [[Feature]] for us)
- [ ] Pricing negotiation (needs $800/mo, we're at $999)

## [[Concerns

1]]. SSO requirement - we [[Don]]'t [[Have]] [[This]] yet (roadmap Q2)
2. [[Price]] sensitivity - bootstrapped [[Company]]
3. [[Technical]] complexity - need white-glove onboarding

## [[Next Steps]]

- [ ] Schedule [[Deep]]-[[Dive]] technical demo (week of [[Jan 13]])
- [ ] [[Get]] pricing [[Approval]] for $800/mo deal
- [ ] Create custom onboarding plan if they convert

## [[Health Score]]: 6/10
